# Groceries for change
Visa Hackathon Project

## Introduction

The **Groceries For Good** project explores how data can be leveraged to help consumers understand the environmental footprint of their grocery shopping choices. The solution provides insights into food waste, packaging, and emissions from transportation. It suggests ways to reduce environmental impact and offers rewards for making sustainable decisions.

- Collaborated with professionals in the sustainability and tech sectors.


## Usage

1. Launch the Jupyter notebook and execute the cells to load and process the data.
2. Visualize the environmental impact of grocery purchases using charts and tables.
3. Review suggestions for reducing carbon footprints, food waste, and other environmental factors.
